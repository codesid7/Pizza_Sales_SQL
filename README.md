# Pizza_Sales_SQl

<p> In this project, we embarked on an extensive data
analysis journey using Structured Query Language
(SQL) to extract, manipulate, and derive insights
from multiple data files. Our objective was to
answer a series of key questions that would help us

within the data. The data files we used spanned
various domains, each contributing unique and
valuable information to our analysis. </p>
