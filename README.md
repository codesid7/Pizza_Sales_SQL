# Pizza_Sales_SQl

<p> In this project, we embarked on an extensive data
analysis journey using Structured Query Language
(SQL) to extract, manipulate, and derive insights
from multiple data files. Our objective was to
answer a series of key questions that would help us
understand patterns, trends, and relationships
within the data. The data files we used spanned
various domains, each contributing unique and
valuable information to our analysis. </p>
